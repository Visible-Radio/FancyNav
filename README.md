Mostly a code along from https://youtu.be/IF6k0uZuypA
But I had to fix a couple things that don't actually work in the code from the demo.
Added:
Clicking outside of the active menu to close it
Full screen menu for mobile
Changed the code to work around the findDOMnode deprecation warning with CSSTransition
